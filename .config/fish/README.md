# Fish Shell Configuration

## Overview

This section documents the Fish shell configuration in my setup, focusing on the usage of aliases, environment variables, functions, and other customizations.

## Aliases

- Various shortcuts for navigating directories (`..`, `...`, etc.), opening and managing files (`vi`, `vig`, `touch2`), and utility commands (`g` for `lazygit`, `chat` for ChatGPT, `code` for code directory navigation).
- `sfish` and `stmux` for sourcing Fish and tmux configuration files.
- `sshOxirs` and `sshconf` for SSH configurations.

## Environment Variables

- Configuration for editors (`VISUAL` and `EDITOR` set to Neovim), shell, and other tools.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `NVM_DIR` for development environment setup.
- Path configurations for Go and other custom scripts.

## Custom Functions

- `tmux-sessionizer` and other bindings for tmux integration.
- `dotfile` function for managing dotfiles.
- `export_env_vars` for setting environment variables from a `.env` file.
- Additional functions for enhanced workflow in Fish.

## Customization and Usage

This configuration is tailored to my personal workflow, making terminal navigation and command execution more efficient. Feel free to customize these configurations to better suit your needs.
